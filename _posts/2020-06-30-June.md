WAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION SCIENCE, John J. BARTHOLDI III & Steven T. HACKMAN

Stark departure from usual readings, but this was an interesting find relevant to my last internship experience. I found that everything I had learnt over the summer was extremely consistent with the information presented in the text. I recommend it to anyone trying to understand warehouses.
