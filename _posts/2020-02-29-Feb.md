*What We Should Know about the People We Don't Know*, Malcolm Gladwell

“Because we do not know how to talk to strangers, what do we do when things go awry with strangers? We blame the stranger.”

My takeaway from this book is the asymmetry between the emotion individual's intend to convey and the emotion that is perceived by others. The manner in which emotions are outwardly communicated in movies, TV, and books is rarely, if ever, the same as reality.
