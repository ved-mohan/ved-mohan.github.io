Created a website to catalogue interesting projects and other ideas. Powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. Creation was easy thanks to Jonathan McGlone's [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#css). I see that there is a lot of scope to improve this website, some examples [here](https://jekyllrb.com/showcase/).
